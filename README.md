 an application in which the user can enter a date using digits and
slashes (for example, “6/24/2012”), and receive output that displays the
date with the month shown as a word (such as “June 24, 2012”). Allow for
the fact that the user might or might not precede a month or day number
with a zero (for example, the user might type “06/24/2012” or “6/24/2012”).
